## Build

Gitlab is not reachable from within lab network, hence please make sure that the intended system is outside lab network (for build to succeed).


- **Clone this project**

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models-yang.git
  cd models-yang/
  ```

- **For Development**

    ```sh
    # Create a tagged docker image
    docker build -t models-yang:dev .
    # Start container and you'll be placed inside the project dir
    docker run -it --name models-yang-dev models-yang:dev
    ```

```sh
# install necessary software for dev environment setup and install dependency
./do.sh deps
# build artifacts
./do.sh art
# clean artifacts
./do.sh clean
# run makefile
make
# generate yang tree
make lint
```
